### Signature Work README

<!--
Signature Work

In your reflection, link to and contextualize at least three GitHub projects that are
either your personal projects, course assignments, or other projects to which you
have contributed
• Your reflection will need to address at least one of the linked projects from a
domain-specific point of view
• Include project-level "README.md" files to describe the linked projects (I will count
each of the linked project "README.md" files that you wrote toward the reflection's
five page count requirement)


THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS (WHAT I LEARNED, WHY I CHOSE THESE PROJECTS, ETC..)

THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT README FILES SHOULD DESCRIBE STUFF LIKE: HOW TO RUN THE PROJECTS, USE THEIR FUNCTIONALITY, THE ASPECTS
THAT MAKE UP THE PROJECTS, AND OTHER VARIOUS PROJECT SPECIFIC INFORMATION.



Project 1: PersonalWebsite
- https://jacklandwer.github.io/PersonalWebsite/
- Is a personal website that I made with HTML, JS, and CSS. 
- Website contains a menu that allows the user to navigate between 5 different pages: Home, Projects, Resume, Fun, and Other.
- Site contains links to relevant information that the user can click to find out more.
- Pages are formatted using foundation api, which allows page content and pictures to be displayed in a uniform matter.
-


Project 2: Project4-VueSPA
- Is a web server that utilizes a RESTfulAPI to create an interactive map that shows crime incidents in St. Paul.
- Incidents are populated on a map, indicated by pin markers, based on the currently-shown section of the map.
- The incidents can be filtered by their metrics: neighborhood, crime type, etc.
- The user can enter location information (coords, neighborhood, street) and the map will change appropriately.
- Users can add new crime incidents to be displayed on the map and added to the database.
- Users can also delete specific crime incidents from the database.
-
- About the project page that describes the functionality of the project with a video demo of it. Also introduces group members.
-



Project 3: cg-illumination
- Site that does gouraud shading and phong shading on different scenes that contain shapes.
- There are multiple scenes that include heightmaps and each have different shape models on them.
- There are multiple lighting sources with different color and light attributes, which can be translated from keyboard input.
