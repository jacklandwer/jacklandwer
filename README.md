Signature Work

Project 1: PersonalWebsite
- Web Development project where I implemented what I learned from class to create a personal website that contains multiple pages that have different information about myself.
- In this project, I learned how to implement the foundation.js framework that aids with the layout/structure of the content that is displayed on the pages. 
- I chose this project because I like doing web development, which is what I will be doing for work after I graduate.


Project 2: Project4-VueSPA
- Web Development project that utilizes a RESTfulAPI along with communication with a database and google maps to populate information about crime incidents in St. Paul neighborhoods. 
- In this project I learned how to implement multiple different APIs that work together to make the project function.
- I chose this project because it was my first experience with creating a project that utilizes multiple APIs.


Project 3: cg-illumination
- Computer Graphics project that implements the Gouraud and Phong shading/illumination methods on various scenes that contain animated objects.
- I learned about Babylon.js and how to use that to make more intricate animated objects.
- I chose this project because I learned a lot about how animations work and are made. I thought this was a very interesting project, and it has made me think about doing more graphics-related coding.
